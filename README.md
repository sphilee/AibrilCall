# Natural Language Understanding Application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-understanding-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-understanding-nodejs?branch=master)

Natural Language Understanding is a collection of APIs that offer text analysis through natural language processing. This set of APIs can analyze text to help you understand its concepts, entities, keywords, sentiment, and more. Additionally, you can create a custom model for some APIs to get specific results that are tailored to your domain.

## Deploy the application using the Deploy to Bluemix button

Clicking on the button below creates a Bluemix DevOps Toolchain and deploys this application to Bluemix.

[![Deploy to Bluemix](https://bluemix.net/deploy/button.png)](https://bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/watson-developer-cloud/natural-language-understanding-nodejs.git)

## Getting started

1. You need a Bluemix account. If you don't have one, [sign up][sign_up].

2. Download and install the [Cloud-foundry CLI][cloud_foundry] tool if you haven't already.

3. Edit the `manifest.yml` file and change `<application-name>` to something unique. The name you use determines the URL of your application. For example, `<application-name>.mybluemix.net`.

  ```yml
  applications:
  - services:
    - my-service-instance
    name: <application-name>
    command: npm start
    path: .
    memory: 512M
  ```

4. Connect to Bluemix with the command line tool.

  ```bash
  cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net
  cf login
  ```

5. Create and retrieve service keys to access the [Natural Language Understanding][service_url] service:

  ```none
  cf create-service natural-language-understanding free my-nlu-service
  cf create-service-key my-nlu-service myKey
  cf service-key my-nlu-service myKey
  ```

6. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the sample `.env.example` file using the following command:

  ```none
  cp .env.example .env
  ```
  You will update the `.env` with the information you retrieved in steps 5.

  The `.env` file will look something like the following:

  ```none
  NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_USERNAME=<username>
  NATURAL_LANGUAGE_UNDERSTANDING_PASSWORD=<password>
  ```

7. Install the dependencies you application need:

  ```none
  npm install
  ```

8. Start the application locally:

  ```none
  npm start
  ```

9. Point your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

10. **Optional:** Push the application to Bluemix:

  ```none
  cf push
  ```

After completing the steps above, you are ready to test your application. Start a browser and enter the URL of your application.

            <your application name>.mybluemix.net

## Troubleshooting

* The main source of troubleshooting and recovery information is the Bluemix log. To view the log, run the following command:

  ```sh
  cf logs <application-name> --recent
  ```

* For more details about the service, see the [documentation][docs] for the Natural Language Understanding service.

### Running in Docker

You'll need to update the `docker.env` file to contain the username, password, and (optionally) the URL
for the NLU service.

```bash
docker build .
docker run -P --env-file docker.env <IMAGEID>
```

## Privacy Notice

Sample web applications that include this package may be configured to track deployments to [IBM Bluemix](https://www.bluemix.net/) and other Cloud Foundry platforms. The following information is sent to a [Deployment Tracker](https://github.com/IBM-Bluemix/cf-deployment-tracker-service) service on each deployment:

* Node.js package version
* Node.js repository URL
* Application Name (`application_name`)
* Space ID (`space_id`)
* Application Version (`application_version`)
* Application URIs (`application_uris`)
* Labels of bound services
* Number of instances for each bound service and associated plan information

This data is collected from the `package.json` file in the sample application and the `VCAP_APPLICATION` and `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variables in IBM Bluemix and other Cloud Foundry platforms. This data is used by IBM to track metrics around deployments of sample applications to IBM Bluemix to measure the usefulness of our examples, so that we can continuously improve the content we offer to you. Only deployments of sample applications that include code to ping the Deployment Tracker service will be tracked.
